I would like to thank the author of this article, https://www.engadget.com/2017-04-19-black-hole-image-jean-pierre-luminet.html, for retrieving the image of the blackhole used in the cascading style sheets in the webpage.

I am also appreciative of the favicon generater hosted by https://icons8.com/icons that allows me to retrive gimmick images for the website user interface.
